Hygienic ERR5RS Record Syntax (reduced)

<h1>Author</h1>

<h1>Status</h1>

??? the draft/final/withdrawn status of the SRFI, information on how
to subscribe to its mailing list, and important dates in its history

<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>
This SRFI provides a specification and portable implementation of an
extension of the ERR5RS record syntax
of <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-131/srfi-131.html">SRFI
131</a>, where field names inserted by macro transformers are
effectively renamed.  This makes this SRFI compatible with the
semantics of the record-type definitions of
the <a href="http://trac.sacrideo.us/wg/raw-attachment/wiki/WikiStart/r7rs.pdf">R7RS</a>
as written.  In addition, field names may also be other types of
Scheme datums, like numbers and strings.
</p>

<h1>Issues</h1>

<p>There are currently no issues known.</p>

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>
There is a still an ongoing discussion about whether the field names
in record definitions in the style
of <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-9/srfi-9.html">SRFI 9</a>
should be raw symbols or identifiers (which are effectively being
renamed when inserted into the output of
a <code>syntax-rules</code>-macro transformer).  When SRFI 9 was
finalized, the question was not as important as it is now because at
that time, record-type definitions were only allowed at top-level,
reducing the chance of conflicts when hygiene is stripped.
</p>

<p>
  Scheme working group 1, which created the
  R7RS, <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scheme-reports-wg1/lk1ssmvgELs/n1j24HqNp2wJ">was
  aware</a> of the problems that non-hygienic matching of field names
  would bring about, and the way the R7RS is worded, an interpretation
  of the text supporting non-hygienic field names seems to be quite a
  stretch.
</p>

<p>This SRFI proposes to extend the <code>define-record-type</code> of
  the R7RS exactly as it is done by SRFI 131 with three exceptions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Field names inserted by hygienic macro transformers are
      effectively renamed making the system hygienic and compatible
      with the R7RS as written.  (Strictly speaking, the text of SRFI
      131 also allows an interpretation of field names as identifiers,
      not symbols, but the fact that it says that it is forward
      compatible
      with <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-99/srfi-99.html">SRFI
      99</a> implies that hygiene is stripped from identifiers.)
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Field names may be identifiers or constants (in the sense of the
      pattern language of 4.3.2 of the R7RS).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Instead of using the field names, one can also use the
    identifiers bound to the accessors by a record-type
    description to refer to fields in the constructors.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The rationale for these changes is as follows:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Hygiene</dt>
  <dd>
    Without hygiene, <code>syntax-rules</code>-macro transformers are
    simply not powerful enough to generate sufficient record-type
    definitions.  For example, the following example by Alex Shinn
    would break:
<pre>
 (define-syntax define-tuple-type
   (syntax-rules ()
     ((define-tuple-type name make pred x-ref (defaults ...))
      (deftuple name (make) pred x-ref (defaults ...) (defaults ...) ()))))

 (define-syntax deftuple
   (syntax-rules ()
     ((deftuple name (make args ...) pred x-ref defaults (default . rest)
	(fields ...))
      (deftuple name (make args ... tmp) pred x-ref  defaults rest
	(fields ... (tmp tmp))))
     ((deftuple name (make args ...) pred x-ref (defaults ...) ()
	((field-name get) ...))
      (begin
	(define-record-type name (make-tmp args ...) pred
	  (field-name get) ...)
	(define (make . o)
	  (if (pair? o) (apply make-tmp o) (make-tmp defaults ...)))
	(define x-ref
	  (let ((accessors (vector get ...)))
	    (lambda (x i)
	      ((vector-ref accessors i) x))))))))

 ;; (make-point [first second]) returns a new point
 ;; (point-ref pt <0 or 1>) fetches the first or second field
 (define-tuple-type point make-point point? point-ref (0 0))

 ;; will output (0 0) if field names are matched hygienically
 (let ((pt (make-point)))
   (write (list (point-ref pt 0) (point-ref pt 1)))
   (newline))
 ;; will output (1 2) if field names are matched hygienically
 (let ((pt (make-point 1 2)))
   (write (list (point-ref pt 0) (point-ref pt 1)))
   (newline))
</pre>    
  </dd>
  <dt>General field names</dt>
  <dd>As child record-types in this SRFI (as in SRFI 131) refer in
    their constructors to fields of their parent record-type by field
    names (but see below) and the matching of these field names must
    be hygienic as well, the identifier naming the field must either
    be unbound both in the scope of the definition of the parent and
    the child record-type or has to share the same binding
    (<em>e.g.</em> as auxiliary syntax) in both scopes.  As this may
    prove to be difficult to ensure when inheritance should happen
    across library boundaries, field names (of fields that are
    supposed to be part of a public interface) may also be constants
    like strings instead of identifiers.  As strings are not being
    changed due to hygiene, all that is feasible with SRFI 131 is also
    feasible with this SRFI.
</dd>
  <dt>Accessors identifying fields</dt>
  <dd>
    When one needs to stick to hygienic field names (that is
    identifiers as field names) but has to cope with the problems
    mentioned above about matching the field names in child
    record-types, one may also use the identifiers bound to the
    accessors of a record-type definition to refer to field names.  As
    these identifiers are always bound to something meaningful and
    name clashes have to be avoided anyway, matching across library
    boundaries using the identifiers bound to the accessors works
    without the problems mentioned above.  (If an identifier names
    both a field and an accessor, the matching of the identifier as a
    field name takes precedence.)
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
  This SRFI can be viewed as a competitor
  to <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-136/srfi-136.html">SRFI
  136</a> by the same author for inclusion in <i>R7RS-large</i>.  Both
  systems emphasize that hygienic field names are possible.  The way
  parent record-type fields are matched in constructor declarations of
  child record-types, however, differs.  While SRFI 136 uses position
  to identify fields (in the spirit of
  the <a href="http://www.r6rs.org">R6RS</a>, this SRFI 150 is more in
  the spirit of the syntax of SRFI 131 (and thus SRFI 99).  (When
  string field names are silently converted to symbols when moving
  from the syntactic to a procedural layer even the interface of SRFI
  99 continues to work with this SRFI.)
</p>

<p>
  Specifying a procedural interface (possibly along the lines of SRFI
  99) as an alternative syntactic interface presented in this SRFI is
  left to a future SRFI when there will have been an agreement on whether keyword
  objects and/or run-time representation (<em>e.g.</em> in the form of
  syntactic closures) of renamed identifiers will be included in a
  future revision of the Scheme report.
</p>

<h1>Specification</h1>

<p>A Scheme system supporting keyword objects
  through <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi/srfi-88">SRFI 88</a>
  should also allow keywords as field names.  Using keywords instead
  of identifiers, one gets back exactly the semantics of SRFI 131 (and SRFI 99).
</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

This SRFI extends 7.1.6 of R7RS-small as follows:

<pre>
 &lt;definition&gt;           
   -&gt; &lt;record-type definition&gt;
 
 &lt;record type definition&gt;
   -&gt; (define-record-type &lt;type spec&gt;
        &lt;constructor spec&gt;
        &lt;predicate spec&gt;
        &lt;field spec&gt; ...)

 &lt;type spec&gt; -&gt; &lt;type name&gt;
             -&gt; (&lt;type name&gt; &lt;parent&gt;)

 &lt;constructor spec&gt;
              -&gt; #f
              -&gt; &lt;constructor name&gt;
              -&gt; (&lt;constructor name&gt; &lt;field name&gt; ...)

 &lt;predicate spec&gt;
              -&gt; #f
              -&gt; &lt;predicate name&gt;

 &lt;field spec&gt; -&gt; (&lt;field name&gt; &lt;accessor name&gt;)
              -&gt; (&lt;field name&gt; &lt;accessor name&gt; &lt;mutator name&gt;)

 &lt;parent&gt;           -&gt; &lt;type name&gt;
                    -&gt; #f

 &lt;type name&gt;        -&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;
 &lt;constructor name&gt; -&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;
 &lt;predicate name&gt;   -&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;
 &lt;accessor name&gt;    -&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;
 &lt;mutator name&gt;     -&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;
 &lt;field name&gt;       -&gt; &lt;identifier&gt;
                    -&gt; &gt;pattern datum&gt;
</pre>

<h2>Semantics</h2>

<p>
  The semantics of a record type definition is the same as in the R7RS
  except for the following additions:
</p>

<p>
  The record-type definition macro-expands into a cluster of definitions that:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>binds the <code>&lt;type name&gt;</code> to the record-type
    descriptor for the new record-type (unless the <code>&lt;type
    name&gt;</code> is <code>#f</code>);</li>
  <li>defines a constructor for instances of the new record-type
    (unless the <code>&lt;constructor spec&gt;</code> is <code>#f</code>);</li>
  <li>defines a predicate that recognizes instances of the new
    record-type and its subtypes (unless the <code>&lt;predicate
    spec&gt;</code> is <code>#f</code>);</li>
  <li>defines an accessor for each field name;</li>
  <li>defines a mutator for each mutable field name</li>
</ul>

<p>
A record type definition extends R7RS with the following additional options:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If a <code>&lt;parent&gt;</code> datum is specified and
    not <code>#f</code>, then it must be an identifier bound to a
    record-type descriptor that serves as the parent record-type for
    the record-type being defined.
  </li>
  <li>If <code>#f</code> is specified for the constructor or predicate,
    then no constructor or predicate procedure is defined. (This is
    useful when the record-type being defined will be used as an
    abstract base class and has no immutable fields.)</li>
  <li>If the constructor name is specified as an identifier,
    then the constructor's arguments correspond to the arguments of
    the parent (if any) followed by the new fields added by this
    record-type definition in the specified order.</li>
  <li>Field names may be identifiers or constants (that is strings,
  characters, booleans or numbers).</li>
</ul>

<p>When a constructor spec is of the form <code>(&lt;constructor
    name&gt; &lt;field name&gt; ...)</code>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each of the <code>&lt;field name&gt;</code>s can either be a
    field name or accessor name declared in the
    same <code>define-record-type</code> form, or any of its ancestor
    ancestor's field names.  Equality is defined as follows: Two
    constants are considered equal if they are equal in the sense
    of <code>equal?</code>.  An identifier is never considered equal
    to a constant.  Two identifiers appearing in two different
    instances of <code>define-record-type</code> are considered equal
    if and only if they have the same lexical binding or the two
    identifiers are the same (taking renaming due to hygiene into
    account) and both have no lexical binding.  Two identifiers
    appearing in the same instance of <code>define-record-type</code>
    are considered equal if binding one identifier would bind the
    other identifier (in other words: both identifiers are the same
    after renaming due to hygiene).  If a field name <code>&lt;field
    name&gt;</code> is considered equal to an identifier naming a
    field name and an identifier naming an accessor, the field name
    takes precedence.  Field names in childs shadow field names in parents.
  </li>
  <li>It is an error if the same field is referenced more than once in
    the a constructor spec.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Implementation</h1>

<p>
The <a href="srfi/150.sld">sample implementation</a> builds
on <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-137/srfi-137.html">SRFI
137</a> to provide unique types.  The syntax is implemented
using <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-148/srfi-148.html">SRFI
148</a>, whose sample implementation relies
on <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-147/srfi-147.html">SRFI
  147</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The implementation also serves as a demonstration for the succinct
  style of the macro system of SRFI 148 (for comparison, take a look
  at the source of SRFI 131 or SRFI 136).
</p>

<p>The <code>define-record-type</code>-identifier exported by the
  library <code>(srfi 150)</code> of the sample implementation is not
  bound to the same syntactic keyword,
  the <code>define-record-type</code>-identifier exported by the core
  library <code>(scheme base)</code>.  This is because the base
  library cannot be portably redefined.
